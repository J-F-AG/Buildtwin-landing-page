                            Wastewater treatment plants process sewer, sewer backup, and industrial wastewater through physical, chemical, and biological treatment processes to remove pollutants. This ensures that treated water meets safety standards before discharge or reuse, reducing health risks and preventing property damage caused by untreated raw sewage.
