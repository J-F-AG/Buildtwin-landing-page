                            Material selection depends on traffic load and demand, climate conditions, subgrade quality, and expected maintenance requirements. Flexible pavements (asphalt) are often used for lower traffic volumes, while rigid pavements (concrete slabs) are chosen for high-volume, high-speed corridors.
