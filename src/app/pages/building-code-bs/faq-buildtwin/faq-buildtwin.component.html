                            British Standards are recommendations by BSI to ensure quality, safety, and efficiency in construction. They play a major role in consistency and enabling best practice in the industry.

                        <p>
                            British codes are not a legal or statutory requirement. They are mainly required by law-bound bodies or registered building control approvers who follow them because the customer requests them.

                                <h3 class="faq-heading">What are approved documents? Are they same as British Standards?</h3>
                            </mat-panel-title>
                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <p>
                            Approved Documents provide guidance on how to meet the building regulations. These are given legal status by the Building Act 1984. Like British standards, there are divided into multiple parts. For example, Part J of the approved documents focuses on combustion appliances and fuel storage systems. However, they are not same as the British Standards.

                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <p>
                            If there is a conflict between the Approved document and the British standards it is important to follow the Approved documents because they are statutory documents and are binding, not the British Standards which are voluntary guidelines and not enforced by building control bodies.

                            BS codes cover a wide range of safety aspects, like fire safety, structural integrity, adoption of safe materials, and best construction practices. It plays a major role in the safety of buildings.
