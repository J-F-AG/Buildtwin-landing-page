                            </mat-panel-title>
                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <p>
                            The Australian building codes board ABCB, on behalf of the state and territory government and Australian government defines NCC 2022. Australian Standards (AS) provide technical details that ensure the quality, performance and safety of construction materials and methods. They tell you how to build, including testing procedures, product specifications and best practice. Australian Standards are often referenced in the NCC but can also exist independently and guide industry professionals in areas not covered by the NCC.
