                            The AISC code is for designing and building safe, durable, and efficient steel 
                            structures.  AISC covers buildings, bridges, industrial facilities, and other 
                            steel structures. These guidelines ensure structural safety, stability and performance of 
                            buildings, bridges and industrial facilities.

                        <p>
                            AISC is not required for all projects. However, many jurisdictions, agencies, 
                            and clients require AISC compliance as a condition of project approval for 
                            steel and other structures. Where it is not required, itâ€™s often used as a best 
                            practice.

                        <p>
                            The AISC Building Code is updated every 5 years to reflect new technology, 
                            industry changes and professional feedback. These updates keep the code 
                            relevant with new materials, techniques and design methods.

                            Yes, small projects can benefit greatly from AISC. Following AISC will mean 
                            better material utilization, cost savings, and easier project approvals, worth 
                            the investment.

                        <p>
                            AISC addresses sustainability by promoting material efficiency, recycling of 
                            steel and energy efficiency in construction. It emphasizes life cycle 
                            assessments to ensure structures are environmentally friendly. AISC also 
                            promotes local sourcing to reduce the carbon footprint of steel production 
                            and transportation.
