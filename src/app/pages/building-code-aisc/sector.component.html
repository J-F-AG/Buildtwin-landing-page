                The AISC Building Code is the foundation of structural integrity and 
                engineering excellence in the construction industry. It is a comprehensive 
                guide that ensures steel structures are safe, reliable and durable across all 
                applications. Whether you’re an architect, engineer or contractor, following 
                AISC is key to structural compliance and industry trust.

                    AISC History
                </h5>
                <p>
                    AISC was founded in 1921 to promote the design and construction of steel 
                    structures. The first edition of this code was published in 1924 for steel 
                    fabricators, owners, detailers,, etc., and over the years, it evolved to include 
                    new technologies, materials and methods. Throughout all these years till 
                    now, AISC Committee has been a leader in structural innovation and safety. 
                    <br>
                    In 1970s, the code was update to add seismic design related information. In 
                    2000s, focus on sustainability and green building was laid to update it 
                    further.

                    Impact of AISC on the Structural Steel Industry
                </h5>
                <p>
                    AISC has changed the structural steel industry by standardizing design, 
                    fabrication and construction processes so projects get done faster with less 
                    variability. Its specifications ensure structural safety through precise material
                    properties, load calculations and connection designs to withstand 
                    environmental and operational stresses. AISC incorporates the latest 
                    research into its specifications so you can adopt new materials, tools, and 
                    techniques for complex challenges.
                    <br>
                    Through publications, certification programs and training through AISC 
                    education foundation, it gives professionals the knowledge and skills to 
                    implement the latest practices. AISC has made the structural steel industry 
                    faster, safer, more innovative and global so you can deliver durable, cost 
                    effective structures that increaes profit margin and meet today’s demands.

                    Design Requirements and Standards
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The code has been divided into several sections owing to the differences in 
                    the design requirements of different structures such as bridges, buildings, 
                    tunnels, etc. For example, AISC 360 and AISC 341 lay out the design 
                    requirements for buildings and building-like structures. Similarly, highway 
                    bridges’ design requirements are established by AASHTO and railroad 
                    bridges’ requirements are given by AREMA.
                    <br>
                    All these, and other similar bodies together, define the complete design 
                    requirements associated with construction in structural steel.

                    Benefits of AISC Compliance
                </h5>
                <ul class="list half">
                    <li>
                        By standardizing material specs, fabrication methods and erection procedures everything is consistent across all phases so you get predictable results and less variables.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        AISC encourages cost-effective construction by offering practical guidelines that make smart use of resources. Project stakeholders can meet project goals within budget without sacrificing quality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The standardized processes help identify potential problems early in the project life cycle so execution is smoother. This reduces rework or safety hazards and saves time and money.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With universal standards, AISC enables teams to work with teams remotely. This is a critical aspect since uniform guidelines mean every stakeholder regardless of their country, can be held to the same stratospheric standards so everyone can work together efficiently.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Buildings and structures designed to AISC specifications are more robust andlast longer. The standards emphasize designs that can resist environmental and operational stresses for you to have a longer life and less maintenance costs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Companies and professionals who observe AISC standards demonstrate their commitment to quality and reliability.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        AISC guidelines help projects to meet green building certifications and sustainability targets.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By requiring testing, quality control, and best practices, AISC guidelines put workers, end-users, and the community in safety first.
