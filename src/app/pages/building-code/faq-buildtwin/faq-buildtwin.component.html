                                What are the basic requirements for AISC certification?

                        <p>
                            AISC certification requires compliance with quality management systems, proper
                            documentation, qualified personnel, and successful completion of audits. The specific
                            requirements vary based on the certification category.

                                How long does AISC implementation typically take?

                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <p>
                            Implementation timeline varies based on project scope and complexity, typically ranging from 6-12 months for full certification. This includes documentation preparation, staff training, and audit processes.

                                What are the cost considerations for AISC compliance?
                            </mat-panel-title>
                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <p>
                            Costs include certification fees, training expenses, documentation systems, and potential equipment upgrades. Return on investment is typically realized through improved efficiency and market access.

                                How often are AISC standards updated?
                            </mat-panel-title>
                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <p>
                            AISC standards are typically reviewed and updated every 5 years, with interim revisions as needed. Organizations must stay current with these updates to maintain compliance.
