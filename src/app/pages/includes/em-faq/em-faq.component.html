                                BuildTwin acts as the platform facilitator, connecting you directly with clients. The contractual relationship 
                                is between you (the service provider) and the client. BuildTwin provides the platform, quality assurance, 
                                and project management tools, while you maintain direct communication and contractual terms with your clients.
