                        <p>
                            BIM is important in the architecture, engineering and construction industries for:
                        </p>
    
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Better Visualization</b>: BIM allows you to create detailed 3D models so you can see the project before it’s built. This helps with decision making and planning.
                            </li>
    
                            <li><b>More Collaboration</b>: With one shared model BIM brings all stakeholders (architects, engineers, contractors) together, making project management easier.
                            </li>
    
                            <li><b>Efficiency and Accuracy</b>: BIM helps you catch conflicts and issues early in the design stage, reduces errors, saves time and minimizes costly changes during construction.
                            </li>
    
                            <li><b>Cost Management</b>: Cost and scheduling integrated into BIM (4D and 5D BIM) means you can budget and resource better and avoid overruns.
                            </li>
    
                            <li><b>Lifecycle Management</b>: Post construction BIM models become a resource for facility management, containing information useful for maintenance and operations. Overall BIM makes construction projects more efficient, accurate and manageable from conception to completion and beyond.
                            </li>

                                What is the difference between BIM and 3D CAD?

                        <p>
                            Both BIM and 3D CAD creates digital models of buildings but there is a big difference:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Data Integration</b>: BIM models are data rich, each element has properties whereas 3D CAD models are geometry only.
                            </li>

                            <li><b>Collaboration</b>: BIM is real time collaboration with multiple stakeholders whereas 3D CAD is individual discipline.
                            </li>

                            <li><b>Lifecycle Management</b>: BIM is for entire lifecycle of a building from design to construction to operation and maintenance. 3D CAD is for design only.
                            </li>

                            <li><b>Clash Detection and Analysis</b>: BIM has advanced tools for clash detection and project analysis which is not present in traditional 3D CAD.
                            </li>

                            <li><b>4D, 5D and Beyond</b>: BIM extends to time (4D), cost (5D), sustainability (6D), facility management (7D) and more, a more comprehensive approach than 3D CAD. In short BIM is a holistic process that brings collaboration, efficiency and decision making throughout the project lifecycle.
                            </li>

                        <p>
                            LOD for your project depends on many factors like project phase, complexity and specific requirements. LOD ranges from 100 to 500:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>LOD 100 (Conceptual Design)</b>: Basic massing models to represent overall project intent.
                            </li>

                            <li><b>LOD 200 (Schematic Design)</b>: Generalized systems and assemblies with approximate quantities, size, shape and location.
                            </li>

                            <li><b>LOD 300 (Detailed Design)</b>: Precise modeling with specific assemblies, accurate quantities and dimensions for coordination.
                            </li>

                            <li><b>LOD 350 (Construction Documentation)</b>: Interfaces between building elements with detailed coordination.
                            </li>

                            <li><b>LOD 400 (Fabrication and Assembly)</b>: Models with complete fabrication and assembly information.
                            </li>

                            <li><b>LOD 500 (As-Built)</b>: Represents the project as built for operations and maintenance.
                            </li>
