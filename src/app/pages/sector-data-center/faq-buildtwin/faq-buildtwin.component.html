                                How does site selection influence data center performance and security?

                        <p>
                            The choice of location impacts risk management, operational efficiency, and connectivity. Factors such as proximity to energy grids, risk of natural disasters, and local data protection laws play significant roles.

                                Can you explain the difference between Tier 3 and Tier 4 data centers?
                            </mat-panel-title>
                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <p>
                            Tier 3 data centers offer N+1 redundancy, allowing any component to be maintained without affecting operations, whereas Tier 4 provides 2N+1 redundancy, ensuring fault tolerance and no downtime even during system failures.

                                What are the advantages of using a modular data center design?
                            </mat-panel-title>
                        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                        <p>
                            Modular designs allow for faster deployment and scalability. They are prefabricated off site, reducing on-site construction time and potentially lowering costs.
