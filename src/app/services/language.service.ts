This aids in better decision-making and planning. Increased Collaboration: By maintaining a single, shared model, BIM improves coordination among various stakeholders, including architects, engineers, and contractors, leading to more streamlined project management. Efficiency and Accuracy: BIM helps in detecting potential conflicts and issues early in the design phase, reducing errors, saving time, and minimizing costly revisions during construction. Cost Management: Integrating cost and scheduling into BIM (as 4D and 5D BIM) allows for more accurate budgeting and resource allocation, preventing overruns. Lifecycle Management: Post-construction, BIM models serve as a resource for facility management, containing detailed information useful for maintenance and operations. Overall, BIM increases the efficiency, accuracy, and manageability of construction projects from conception through to completion and beyond."

Collaboration: BIM enables real-time collaboration among various stakeholders, whereas 3D CAD is often limited to individual disciplines. Lifecycle Management: BIM supports the entire lifecycle of a building, from design and construction to operation and maintenance. 3D CAD typically focuses on the design phase only. Clash Detection and Analysis: BIM provides advanced tools for clash detection and project analysis, which are not inherent in traditional 3D CAD. 4D, 5D, and Beyond: BIM extends to include time (4D), cost (5D), sustainability (6D), and facility management (7D), offering a more comprehensive approach than 3D CAD.
